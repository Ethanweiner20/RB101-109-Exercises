## Find the Duplicate

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: An _array_ with exactly one duplicate
- **Output**: The duplicate value

*Clarifications*:
- The array will contain exactly one duplicate (that only occurs twice)

*Questions*:
- Can the array contain any type?
- Can the array contain multiple types?
- Is an empty array input allowed?
- Is a on-element array input allowed?

*Assumptions*:
- The array must contain at least 2 elements

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The duplicate value does not have to be next to each other

*Mental Models*:

          85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,

          7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73

## DATA STRUCTURES

Array

## ALGORITHM

# Solution 1 (Straightforward)

Given an _array_ with exactly one duplicate:

- Set an index to 1
- For each `element` in _array_
  - Check if any of the elements before `index` have the same value as `element`
  - If so, return that value as the duplicate
  - Increment the index
- Display some message stating that no duplicate was found

# Solution 2 (Intuitive)

Given an _array_ with exactly one duplicate:

- Pop the last `element` from the array
- Check if that `element` is included in the remaining array
- If so, return that element as the duplicate
- Otherwise, repeat the first steps until the array is empty

## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- Use #== to compare elements (most-all types have a #== method)
- Array#pop
