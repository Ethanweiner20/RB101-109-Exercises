## Cute angles

## PROBLEM
 
*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A floating point number representing an _angle_ between 
- **Output**: A string describing the angle in terms of degrees, minutes, and seconds
- Minutes & seconds should always be 2 digits (leading zeroes if necessary)
- Degrees can be 1-3 digits

*Questions*:

*Implicit Requirements*:
- An input of 360 can either represent 360 degrees or 0 degrees
- The string must be in the format: DD°MM'SS"

*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

dms(30) == %(30°00'00")
dms(76.73) == %(76°43'48")
dms(254.6) == %(254°36'00")
dms(93.034773) == %(93°02'05")
dms(0) == %(0°00'00")
dms(360) == %(360°00'00") || dms(360) == %(0°00'00")

## DATA STRUCTURES

No special data structures are needed.

## ALGORITHM

Given a floating point _angle_ in the range [0, 360]:

- Determine the degrees of _angle_ by rounding down
- Subtract degrees from _angle_ to retrieve the remaining degrees
- Convert the remaining degrees to remaining minutes
- Determine the minutes by rounding down
- Subtract the remaininng minutes from minutes to retrieve the remaining minutes
- Convert the remaining minutes to seconds
- Determine the seconds by rounding down
- Format the degrees, minutes, and seconds into a result

*Sub-Problems*:

Determine the minutes for a given number of degrees: Multiply by 60

Determine the seconds for a given number of minutes: Multiply by 60

*Implementation Details*:
- Use % to create a string literal

## FURTHER EXPLORATION

Solution: Use modulus division to retrieve the degrees within the range [0, 360]

## IMPROVEMENTS

- My solution intermittently rounds, which isn't really necessary here. Instead, we could just format at the end.
