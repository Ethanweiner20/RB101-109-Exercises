## Combining Arrays

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: Exactly 2 arrays, _array1_ and _array2_
- **Output**: An array containing all of the values from _array1_ and
_array2_
- There should be no duplication in the final array

*Questions*:
- Does the return value have to be a new array, or can it be one of the
original arrays?
- Does order of the final array matter?

*Assumptions*
- The return value must be a new array
- The order of the final array should start with elements in _array1_ and end
with elements exclusively in _array2_

*Implicit Requirements*:

*Notes*:
- Don't just append the elements of array 2 onto array 1 and return array 1. This would result in a non-new object being returned, which is not what we assumed the problem requested.

*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

merge([1, 3, 5], [3, 6, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 6, 9]

## DATA STRUCTURES

We will initialize a new array to push our results to.

## ALGORITHM

Given _array1_ and _array2_:

- Initialize a new empty array `merged`
- Push every element from `array1` to `merged`
- Push every element from `array2` to `merged` that is not also in `array1`
- Return the merged array

*Sub-Problems*:



## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- We can use Array#<< operator to append elements
