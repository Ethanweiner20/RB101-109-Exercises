## Reversed Arrays (Part 1)

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: An _array_
- **Output**: The original array _reversed_
- This method should mutate the original array and return it
- You may not use Array#reverse or Array#reverse!

*Questions*:

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The array can contain any ypes
- The array only reverses the order of its elements -- not the elements
themselves
- A reversed empty array is simply an empty array

*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

list = [1,2,3,4]
result = reverse!(list)
result == [4, 3, 2, 1] # true
list == [4, 3, 2, 1] # true
list.object_id == result.object_id # true

list = %w(a b e d c)
reverse!(list) == ["c", "d", "e", "b", "a"] # true
list == ["c", "d", "e", "b", "a"] # true

list = ['abc']
reverse!(list) == ["abc"] # true
list == ["abc"] # true

list = []
reverse!(list) == [] # true
list == [] # true

## DATA STRUCTURES

We will use an Array to reverse the lists. We might need to use a temporary
array in order to mutate in place.

## ALGORITHM

# Solution 1 (Swapping):

Given an _array_:

- Initialize an index to zero
- Loop
  - Swap the element at `index` with the element at `-index`
  - Increment the index by 1
  - Stop swapping once we've iterated at least halfway through the array
- Return _array_

# Solution 2 . . .

*Sub-Problems*:

# Determine when to stop iterating (when we are halfway)

Given an _index_ and an _array_

- Determine if the index is AT LEAST half of the array length
- If so, then we have iterated halfway through the array

*If the array has an odd length, the final index will be before the middle
element *
*If the array has an even length, the final index will be right before halfway*

# Examples

e.g. array = [1, 2, 3]; halfway point = 3 / 2 = 1
e.g. array = [1, 2, 3, 4]; halfway point = 4 / 2 = 2

## CODE

*Implementation Details*:

- We can use negative indicies to access the elements in reverse order
