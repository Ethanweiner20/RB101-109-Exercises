## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A short line of _text_
- **Output**: _text_ displayed in a box

*Questions*:
- Do all characters have the same width in the terminal? Yes

*Assumptions*:
- The input will always fit in your terminal window

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The method should be able to deal w/ empty text
- The string should have a horizontal padding of 1 space on each side
- There should be one empty line above & below the text

*Mental Models*:
1. Use length of the text to determine the # of '-' to border to the box with

## EXAMPLES/TESTS

print_in_box('To boldly go where no one has gone before.')

## DATA STRUCTURES

No special data structures are needed here.

However, we might want to use an array to store the outputted lines.

## ALGORITHM

Given a string _text_:

Set lines = []
Set inner width of box to the length of text + 2

Create the first line: + plus inner width '-'s plus +
+
Create the 2nd line: | plus inner width ' 's plus |
Create the middle line: | plus text (w/ a space padding) plus |
Use the first & 2nd lines again here

*Idea*: Abstract line creations into a method

*Sub-Problems*:




## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- String#* for concatenation
- String#center for padding

## Further Exploration

# ALGORITHM (for creating the middle lines)

MAX_LINE_LENGTH = 80 - 2(2) = 76

Given a string _text_, and an _inner_width_:

- Break _text_ into an array of `lines` of inner width length max
- Create all the lines using `lines`

*Sub-Problems*

*Break up the text*:

Given a string _text_, and a _max_line_length_:

- Initialize an array `lines` to contain each line of text
- Split _text_ into `words`
- Initialize a starting word index to 0

- While starting index is less than the length of _words_:
  - Create a line containing words, with a max length of max_line_length
  - Add this lines to `lines`
  - Increment the starting index by the word length of the `line`

- Return the lines

*Create a line*

Given _words_, and a _max_line_length:

- Initialize the line to an empty string
- Append words, starting at starting_index_, to the line until either:
  - We have reached the end of words array
  - Adding another word would exceed the character limit
- Join the words
- Pad the rest with spaces until max_line_length is reached

# EXAMPLES

string: "Ethan is very cool", max_line_length: 16

"Ethan is very cool" =>
Ethan is very
cool

# SUMMARY

- Create the borders
- Create the lines of text
    - Split the text into words
    - Create each line until we have iterated through all the words
        - Determine the words for each line by appending words until adding an additional word will exceed the line length
        - Join the words for each line, and pad with spaces on the right
- Print the borders and lines
