## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _string_ that may contain consecutive duplicate characters
- **Output**: A new string that contains the value of the original string with any consecutive duplicate characters collapsed into a single character
- You may not use String#squeeze[!]

*Questions*:
- Should spaces be considered a character?
- Can uppercase characters be included?
- If so, is the solution case-sensitive?

*Implicit Requirements*:
- This method can work on any alphanumeric characters
- Crunching an empty string returns an empty string

*Assumptions*:
- All valid characters can be considered duplicates --- including spaces
- The solution must be case-sensitive -- e.g. "Aa" is not considered a duplicate

*Mental Models*:
1. [Iterative Solution] Iterate over the given string, and only append the character if it is not a consecutive duplicate
2. [Use Regex] Substitute any sequences of duplicate characters with that singular character

## EXAMPLES/TESTS

crunch('ddaaiillyy ddoouubbllee') == 'daily double'
crunch('4444abcabccba') == '4abcabcba'
crunch('ggggggggggggggg') == 'g'
crunch('a') == 'a'
crunch('') == ''

## DATA STRUCTURES

In order to iterate over the string, we will use an array of its characters.

## ALGORITHM

# Solution 1

Given a _string_:

- Set crunched_string = ''
- For each character in _string_:
  - If the character is equivalent to the last character in crunched_string, then skip over it
  - Otherwise, append that character
- Return the crunched_string

# Solution 2:
- Find all instances of character sets with one or more characters; return each of the indices at which these character sets exist
- Construct a new string with only these characters

# Solution 3:
- Find all instances of characters sets with one or more characters
- Select all the characters in each of those sets besides the first one
- Replace that with an empty string

*Sub-Problems*:


## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- String#each_char will come in handy
- The regular expression /[.]{2,}/ might come in handy for matching character sets

## Further Exploration

The solution doesn't use each_char or chars because it wouldn't have access to the next character in the string. There are multiple ways to make this solution work:
- You could chain the #with_index method so that the index is still accessible
to access the next character in the string
- Reframe the method such that you compare the current character with the PREVIOUS character (which can be obtained using `crunch_text[-1]`), rather than
the next character.
