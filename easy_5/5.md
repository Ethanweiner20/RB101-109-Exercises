## Clean up the words

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A lowercase _string_, that may include non-alphabetic characters
- **Output**: A new string, with all non-alphabetic characters from _string_ replaced by spaces
- If more than one non-alphabetic character exists in a row, only one space should be included in the output (the result should never have consecutive spaces)
- Any non-alphabetic characters can be inputted

*Implicit Requirements*:
- Leading/trailing spaces are allowed

*Questions*
- Should I mutate and return the original string object, or should I return a new string object entirely?

*Mental Models*:
1. Replace all non-alphabetic characters w/ spaces first. Replace any sequences of one or more spaces w/ a singular space.

## EXAMPLES/TESTS

cleanup("---what's my +*& line?") == ' what s my line '

## DATA STRUCTURES

We might consider using an Array to store each character. But this won't be necessary if we just use Regex.

## ALGORITHM

Given a _string_ with non-alphabetic characters:

- Replace all non-alphabetic characters with spaces
- Replace all sequences of more than one space with a singular space

*Sub-Problems*:

# -----------------------
# PROBLEM

Condense the whitespace in a string
- *Input*: A string that might contain whitespace
- *Output*: The same string, with any sequences of multiple space characters condensed to a singular space character

# EXAMPLES

condense_whitespace("   what s my  line  ") == " what s my line " 

# ALGORITHM

Given a _string_:

- Initialize a result variable = ''
- Iterate over each character in string
  - If the character isn't a space, add it to result
  - If the character is a space:
    - Add it to result unless the last character in result is a space
    - Otherwise, just don't add it
- Return the result variable
