## Letter Counter (Part 1)

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _string_ of space-separated words
- **Output**: Hash that displays the # of words of different sizes
  - Key = Size of a given word
  - Value = # of words of a given size
- Words consist of any string of characters that do include a space
- Hash keys and values are integers

*Questions*:
- Should the hash be ordered by word size? No -- not all examples are ordered

*Implicit Requirements*:
- Words can contain special characters
- An empty string returns an empty hash

*Mental Models*:
1. Split the string into words. Iterate over the words, and accumulate key-value pairs (size-count pairs) as we iterate.

## EXAMPLES/TESTS

word_sizes('Four score and seven.') == { 3 => 1, 4 => 1, 5 => 1, 6 => 1 }
word_sizes('Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!') == { 3 => 5, 6 => 1, 7 => 2 }
word_sizes("What's up doc?") == { 6 => 1, 2 => 1, 4 => 1 }
word_sizes('') == {}

## DATA STRUCTURES

- We will use an array to store the words
- We will use a hash to store the sizes and counts of words

## ALGORITHM

Given a _string_ of space-separated words:

- Split the string among spaces to retrieve the `words`
- Initialize a counts hash to {}, with default values of 00
- For each `word` in `words`:
  - Increment the counts hash at the key corresponding to the size of the given word by 1
- Return the counts hash

- String#size
- Index into hash w/ integer keys
