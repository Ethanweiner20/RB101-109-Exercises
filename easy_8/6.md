## Fizzbuzz

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _start_ number and and _end_ number
- **Output**: Display all 

*Questions*:
- Do the numbers have to be integers?
- What should the output be if the numbers are equivalent or backwards?

*Assumptions*:
- The input numbers must be integers

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The input numbers should be included in the printed list
- The format of the printed list should be such that they are separated by commas

*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz

## DATA STRUCTURES



## ALGORITHM

Given a _start_ number and _end_ number:

- Create a range from the start number to the end number
- Transform that range into an array of strings:
  - If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5, return "Fizzbuzz"
  - If the number is divisible by 3 ONLY, return "Fizz"
  - If the number is divisible by 5 ONLY, return "Buzz"
  - If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the string version of that number
- Join the array of strings, w/ ', ' between the string
- Print the joined string
