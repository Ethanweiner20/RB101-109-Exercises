## Sum of Sums

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: An array of _numbers_
- **Output**: The sum of every leading subsequence of the Array

*Questions*:

*Assumptions*:
- The array must always contain at least one #

*Implicit Requirements*:


*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == (3) + (3 + 5) + (3 + 5 + 2) # -> (21)
sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == (1) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 5 + 7 + 3) # -> (36)
sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35

## DATA STRUCTURES



## ALGORITHM

# Solution 1: Procedural

Given an array of _numbers_:

- Initialize a total sum to zero
- Iterate over the numbers, keeping track of the `index`
  - Determine the current subsequence by slicing the array, starting at index 0 with a total length of `index + 1`
    * The final index is the array length - 1, and we want our final subsequence to be the whole array length
  - Add this sum to the total sum
- Return the total sum
