# Diamonds!

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: An odd integer `n`
- **Output**: A displayed diamond in an `n` x `n` grid

*Questions*:
- Can the argument be negative? Assume no

*Implicit Requirements*:
- * should be used for each point of the diamond
- The diamond should not be hollow (fill it in w/ *)
- Rows increment in lengths of 2

*Edge Cases*:
- Diamond of size 1 => 1 star


*Mental Models*:
1. Display the first n/2, the middle row, and the last n/2 (the first n/2 reversed)
2. Iterate n times, displaying the row at each

# EXAMPLES/TESTS

[See in rb file]

# DATA STRUCTURES

- Array to store each row

# ALGORITHM

# Solution 1

Given the diamond size `n`:
- Initalize a `first_half` to an empty array
- Iterate over the odd #s in `1` to `n`**, tracking the `num_stars`
  - Create the `row` by center justifying `num_stars` within a row of size `n`**
  - Append the `row` to `second_half`
- Create the `middle_row`: `n` starts (#*)
- Create the `second_half` by reversing the first half (#reverse)
- Print the `first_half`, `middle_row`, and `second_half`

*Sub-Problems*:

# Iterate over the odd #s in `1` to `n`:

- Select the odd #s from `1` to `n` (#select) OR
- Initialize an index `num_stars` to 1
- Iterate while `num_stars` jis less than `n`
  - Add 2 to `num_stars` in each iteration

# Center justify stars

Note: The num_stars and total_width are both odd, so their difference is even. This means we can divide the padding evenly.

Given the `num_stars` and `total_width`:
- Determine the `padding` by dividing `total_width` - `num_stars` by 2
- Add this `padding` in spaces to the left and right of `num_stars` stars
- Return this string
