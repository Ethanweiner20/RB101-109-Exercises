# Word to Digit

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A `sentence` string
- **Output**: The string `sentence` with any sequences of digits (as words) converted to a string of numerical digits

*Questions*:
- Can there be multiple sequences of digits?
  - Assumption: Yes
- Does a single digit count as a sequence?
  - Assumption: Yes
  - If this was true, we could just replace any words w/ their corresponding digit...

*Implicit Requirements*:
- Sequence of digits will be separated by spaces
- The string of digits should be separated by spaces

*Edge Cases*:

- Single digit sequences: Should not be affected
- Digits (numerical) are included in the original string: Should not be affected

*Mental Models*:

1. Procedural: Build a string using a sequence accumulator that accumulates any sequences being created. If the sequence has at least two digits, convert to numbers. Append sequence once it's done.
2. Better: Break the string into substrings, in which digit sequences compose their own substring. Convert sequences to digit strings.

# EXAMPLES/TESTS

word_to_digit('Please call me at five five five one two three four. Thanks.') == 'Please call me at 5 5 5 1 2 3 4. Thanks.'

# DATA STRUCTURES

- Input: String
- Intermediate: [Solution 2] Array to contain substrings
- Intermediate: [Solution 1] Array to contain words
- Output: String

# ALGORITHM

## Solution 1

Idea: Use a hash to store the appropriate strings

Given a string `sentence`:
- Initialize an empty string `sentence_with_digits`
- Initialize a `sequence` to an empty array
- Iterate over the words in `sentence`
  - If the word is a number, append it to the sequence
  - Otherwise:
    - If the sequence contains elements, convert & append all numbers in `sequence`**
    - Reset the sequence to an empty array
    - Append the current word to `sentence_with_digits`
- Convert & append any leftover numbers remaining in the `sequence`**

## Solution 2

Given a string `sentence`:
- Break up the sentence into substrings, in which digit sequences comprise their own substrings**
- Transform each substring:

*Sub-Problems*:

# Reduce the numbers in a sequence to a string of digits

Given a `sequence`:
- Transform each number in the sequence to a digit
- Join the sequence with spaces

# CODE

*Implementation Details*:

# Further Exploration

Given a `sentence`:
- Split the `sentence` into `words`
- Initialize the `result_words` to an empty array
- Initialize a sequence accumulator to an empty array
- Iterate over the `words`, tracking every `word`:
  - If the full `word` matches any of the digit keys:
    - Add the `word` to the `digits_sequence`
  - Otherwise:
    - If the sequence contains elements (has length), collapse it into a singular string
    - Append the collapsed digits to `result_words`
    - Add `word` to the `result_words`
- Collapse and add any remaining digits sequence
- Join the `result_words` with spaces in between

## Collapsing a digits sequence

- Transform the words in the sequence to numbers
- If the sequence has a length of 10:
  - Format as a phone #
- Otherwise, join the sequence (w/o spaces) and add it to the `result_words`

## Formatting as a phone number

( + join first three + ) + ' ' + join next 3 + - + join final four
