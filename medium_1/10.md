# Fibonacci Numbers (Last Digit)

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: An integer `n`
- **Output**: The last digit of the `nth` Fibonacci #

*Questions*:


*Implicit Requirements*:
- We have to deal with very large Fibonacci #s, with many digits
  - Iterating over the digits to retrieve the last is not a feasible solution
  - #last is most likely implemented that way

*Edge Cases*:



*Mental Models*:
1. Computing the last digit of a particular fibonacci # does not require the fibonacci # itself -- we can simply continually add the last digits

e.g. 413 + 528 => last digit == 1; can be determined just from 3 + 8

# EXAMPLES/TESTS

fibonacci_last(15)        # -> 0  (the 15th Fibonacci number is 610)
fibonacci_last(20)        # -> 5 (the 20th Fibonacci number is 6765)
fibonacci_last(100)       # -> 5 (the 100th Fibonacci number is 354224848179261915075)
fibonacci_last(100_001)   # -> 1 (this is a 20899 digit number)
fibonacci_last(1_000_007) # -> 3 (this is a 208989 digit number)
fibonacci_last(123456789) # -> 4

# DATA STRUCTURES



# ALGORITHM

Given a positive integer `n`:
- Set `previous_last_digit` to 0, and set `current_last_digit` to 1
- Iterate `n - 1` times:
  - Sum the 2 last digits
  - Set the `previous_last_digit` to the `current_last_digit`
  - Set the `current_last_digit` to the last digit of the sum
- Return the `current_last_digit`

Why this works?
- If we know the last 2 digits of the previous 2 fibonacci #s, we can determine the last digit of the current fibonacci #
  - Simply sum the last 2 digit, and find the last digit of that (% 10)
- We have a "starting case" of 1 and 0

# Further Exploration

Determine a solution that works instantly for large numbers. It shouldn't need to continually the sum the last digits, or else that would require too many iterations. There should be a mathematical pattern to the last digits.

If we can find 2 pairs in the sequence that have the same 2 last digits, then each of their next numbers should be the same, which should create a continual pattern. We just need to find where the pattern begins to repeat. We could possibly determine at what intervals the pattern repeats algorithmically, and then use this interval index.

## Algorithm

## Problem 1: Determine the increment at which the pattern repeats



## Problem 2: Use the increment to determine the nth last digit

e.g. Pretend last digits: [0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 5, 6, 4...]

pattern_length = 4
Any nth digit can be derived by just knowing the pattern. If n is 6 in this example, we can determine the index of the pattern by doing (6 - 1) % 4 == 2 

Given the increment and the `nth` digit:
- Create an array of the pattern
  - The pattern starts repeating once the last 2 digits are the same as the first 2 digits
- Find the remainder of dividing (n - 1) by the length of the pattern determine the index of the pattern
- Return the digit in the pattern at that index
