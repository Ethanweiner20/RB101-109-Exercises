# Stack Machine Interpretation

# PROBLEM

## What is a stack-and-register programming language?

- **Register**: Holds the value of current significance
- **Stack**: Stores other values to be used for calculations
  - Operates w/ a push/pop behavior
  - Push: Register -> Stack
  - Pop: Stack -> Register
- How do operations work?
  - Operations have 2 arguments: the register value, & the value at the top of the stack
  - Pop values from the stack + performs operation w/ popped value & register value
  - Store result of operation in register
- How can a stack be represented in Ruby? Using an array


*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A string of `code` that represents code in a stack-and-register programming language
- **Output**: Anything printed in the code

*Assumptions*:
- All programs supplied are valid programs
  - Contain only known tokens/commands
  - Will not perform illegal operations

*Questions*:
- We need to maintain the state of the register. How can we store a value into the register?
  1. Use a hash with a register, and index into the register as needed
  2. Use variable reassignment

*Implicit Requirements*:
- Should be able to handle uneven integer division -- round down to nearest whole #

*Edge Cases*:

- No print commands are provided
  - Print nothing

*Mental Models*:

# 15

minilang('5 PRINT PUSH 3 PRINT ADD PRINT')

# 7

minilang('3 PUSH PUSH 7 DIV MULT PRINT ')
# 6

minilang('4 PUSH PUSH 7 MOD MULT PRINT ')
# 12

minilang('-3 PUSH 5 SUB PRINT')
# 8

minilang('6 PUSH')
# (nothing printed; no PRINT commands)

# DATA STRUCTURES

- Input: String
- Commands: Store in an array
- Stack: Use an array
- Output: Printed integers (or nothing)

# ALGORITHM

Given `code` from a made-up stack-and-register language:
- Initialize a stack to an empty array
- Initialize a register to 0
- Break up the `code` into individual `commands`
- For each `command` in `commands`:
  - If the `command` is an integer**:
    - Store the `command`, as an integer, in the register
  - If the `command` is "PRINT"
    - Print the value in the `register`
  - If the `command` is "PUSH"
    - Push register value onto stack
  - If the `command` is "POP
    - Pop from the stack and store in the register
  - Otherwise:
    - Perform the `command`**, updating the `stack` as necessary
    - Store the `result` from the `command` in the `register`

*Sub-Problems*:

## Operations

Given a `stack` and `register_value`:
- ADD: Pop value from stack, add value w/ register value, return new value
- SUB: Pop value from register, substract it from register value, return new value
- MULT: ...
- DIV: ... [integer division]
- MOD: ...
