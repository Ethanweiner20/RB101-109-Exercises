# Grocery List

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: An 'grocery_list', which is a 2-element array of fruits, w/ each key-value pair containing the fruit and its integer quantity
- **Output**: A 1-dimensional array w/ the correct # of each fruit

*Questions*:
- Should the fruit be included if its quanity is 0
- Can negative quantities be included?

*Assumptions*:
- The fruit should not be included if its quantity is 0

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The quantity must be an integer (no partial quantities)

*Mental Models*:
1. Transform key-value pairs to arrays w/ correct quantities, flatten

# EXAMPLES/TESTS

buy_fruit([["apples", 3], ["orange", 1], ["bananas", 2]]) ==
  ["apples", "apples", "apples", "orange", "bananas","bananas"]

# DATA STRUCTURES

- Input: Array of key-value pairs
- Output: 1-d array
- Intermediate: Array of independently sized arrays

# ALGORITHM

## Solution 1: Using abstractions

- Given a 'grocery_list' array:
- *Transform each fruit-quantity pair to an array that contains the fruit the # of times specified its associated quantity*
- Flatten the transformed array

## Solution 2: Procedural

- Initialize an empty array
- Iterate through every key value pair
  - Iterate quantity times
    - Append the fruit to the outer array
- Return the array

*Sub-Problems*:

## Transform a fruit-quantity pair:

- Given a 'fruit' and a 'quantity':
  - Initialize an empty array
  - Iterate 'quantity' times
    - Append the 'fruit' to the array on each iteration
  - Return the array



# CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- Array#map and Array#flatten
- Array#reduce can abstract some of the logic for the sub-problem OR
- Use Array#new to build the array with the same of multiple elements
