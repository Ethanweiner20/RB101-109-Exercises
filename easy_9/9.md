# Grade Book

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: Three scores, 'score1', 'score2', 'score3'
  - Each score will be in the range [0, 100]
- **Output**: The letter value associated with the mean grade

*Questions*:
- Should the mean be rounded?

*Assumptions*:
- Do not round the mean during computation; use its decimal value

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The return value should be a single-character string

*Mental Models*:
- 2 part problem: Determine the mean, convert the mean numerical grade => letter value


# EXAMPLES/TESTS

get_grade(95, 90, 93) == "A"
get_grade(50, 50, 95) == "D"

# DATA STRUCTURES

- Input: Three integers

# ALGORITHM

- *Determine the mean of the scores*
- *Compute the letter grade for that mean*

*Sub-Problems*:

*Determine the mean of the scores*
- Given a an array of 'scores':
- Add up the 'scores' & divide by the total # of them


*Compute the letter grade for that mean*
- Given a 'score'
- Check the 'score' against the 5 cases
- Return the letter associated with that case

# CODE

*Implementation Details*:

# Further Exploration

I would change the 'else' condition in the case statement to an explicit range, 0...60. Then the else clause would encapsulate only mean scores that are greater than 100. I would return a different string for that clause, e.g. 'EC'
