# How long are you?

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _string_
- **Output**: An array containing every word from the string, appended with a space and the word length
- Words are separated by exactly one space
- Any substring of non-space characters should be considered a word

*Questions*:
- How to treat leading/trailing whitespace?

*Implicit Requirements*:


*Mental Models*:


# EXAMPLES/TESTS

word_lengths("cow sheep chicken") == ["cow 3", "sheep 5", "chicken 7"]

word_lengths("baseball hot dogs and apple pie") ==
  ["baseball 8", "hot 3", "dogs 4", "and 3", "apple 5", "pie 3"]

word_lengths("It ain't easy, is it?") == ["It 2", "ain't 5", "easy, 5", "is 2", "it? 3"]

word_lengths("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") ==
  ["Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 34"]

word_lengths("") == []

# DATA STRUCTURES



# ALGORITHM

Given a _string_ of words:
- Split the string into `words`
- Transform the `words`
  - For each word, append a space and its length
- Return the transformation
