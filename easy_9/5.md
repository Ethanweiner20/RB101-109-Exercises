# Uppercase Check

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _string_ with any characters
- **Output**: A Boolean stating whether all of the alphabetic characters in the string are uppercase
- Non-alphabetic characters, including spaces, should be ignored

*Questions*:
- 

*Implicit Requirements*:
- An empty string input results in a return value of string


*Mental Models*:


# EXAMPLES/TESTS

uppercase?('t') == false
uppercase?('T') == true
uppercase?('Four Score') == false
uppercase?('FOUR SCORE') == true
uppercase?('4SCORE!') == true
uppercase?('') == true

# DATA STRUCTURES

- We will use an array to select the alphabetic characters

# ALGORITHM

# Solution 1: Use an array

Given a _string_:
- Split the string into characters
- Select the characters that are alphabetic
- Check if all of those characters are uppercase
- If so, return true; otherwise, return false

# Solution 2: Pattern matching

Given a _string_:
- Delete all non-alphabetic characters from the string
- Check if the remaining string includes only uppercase characters

# Solution 3: Clever
- Does the original string match its uppercased version

*Why does this work?*: If the string contains any uppercase letters, uppercasing it shouldn't change anything

*Sub-Problems*:




# CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- For checking whether characters are uppercase: Use Regex pattern matching with =~
- String#delete
- Array#select

# Further Exploration

The problem states that the purpose of `uppercase?` is to return true if ALL characters in the string are uppercase. By definition, all of the characters in an empty string are uppercase. At the same time, none of the characters in an empty string are uppercase -- but the condition is still met regardless.

If the method's purpose was to return true if at least one character in the string is uppercase -- that would change this.
