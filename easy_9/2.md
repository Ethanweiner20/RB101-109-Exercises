# Double Doubles

# PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _number_
- **Output**: A number that is either:
  - _number_, if _number_ is double number
  - Double the _number_

*Domain Knowledge*:
- A double number is a number w/ an even # of digits whose left-side digits are exactly the same as its right-side digits (in the same order)

*Questions*:
- Can the input number be negative?
- Does the input number have to be an integer?
- Can the input number have leading zeroes?

*Implicit Requirements*:
- The method should be able to handle very large numbers

*Mental Models*:

# DATA STRUCTURES



# ALGORITHM

## Solution 1 (string-based)

Given a _number_:
- Determine if _number_ is a double
- If yes, then return the _number_
- Otherwise return the _number_ times 2

*Sub-Problems*:

## Determine if a number is a double

*Assumption*: The input argument is an actual number

Given a _number_:
- Convert the number to a string
- If the string has even length:
  - Partition the string into 2 strings: first half & second half
  - If the first half is equivalent to the second half, then the number is a double
  - Otherwise, the number is not a double
- Otherwise, the number is not a double

## Partition an string into 2 halfs:

Given a _string_:
- Set a variable `half_length` equal to half the string length
- The first half starts at the index 0, with a length of `half_length`
- The second half starts at the index `half_length`, with a length of `half_length`

*Example*: 'abcd' => 'ab', 'cd' ==== [0, 2], [2, 4]
