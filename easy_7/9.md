## Multiply All Pairs

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: Two arrays of numbers, _array1_ and _array2_
- **Output**: An array containing the product of every pair of numbers that can be formed between _array1_ and _array2_, sorted in ascending order

*Questions*:


*Implicit Requirements*:
- The arrays do not have to be the same size
- The array should contain duplicates for duplicate products
- The total number of products is equal to the product of the array lengths

*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

multiply_all_pairs([2, 4], [4, 3, 1, 2]) == [2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 12, 16]

## DATA STRUCTURES

We will use a 2-dimensional array to collect the pairs of numbers.
We will use a 1-dimensional array to store the products.

## ALGORITHM

Given two arrays of numbers, _array1_ and _array2_
- Compute the `cartesian_product` of the 2 arrays: create a new array w/ all pairs of arrays
- Transform the pairs to products
  - Reduce each pair to its product
- Sort the products in ascending numerical order

*Sub-Problems*:




## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- Array#product can compute the cartesian product
- Array#sort sorts in ascending order by default
