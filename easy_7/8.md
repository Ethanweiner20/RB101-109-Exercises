## Multiply Lists

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: Two arrays of numbers, _array1_ and _array2_
- **Output**: An array whose elements comprise of the product of an element in array1 and array2 at the corresponding index

*Questions*:
- Can the arrays be empty?
- Can the arrays contain non-integer numbers?

*Assumptions*:
- The arrays contain the same # of elementse

*Implicit Requirements*:


*Mental Models*:
1. Iterate over one of the arrays with the index and add the product to a separate array.
2. Transpose the arrays into 2-element sub-arrays, and sum each sub-array


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

multiply_list([3, 5, 7], [9, 10, 11]) == [27, 50, 77]

## DATA STRUCTURES

We will use an array to collect the products.

## ALGORITHM

# Solution 1

Given two arrays of numbers _array1_ and _array2_:

- Initialize an empty products array
- Initialize an index to zero
- Iterate through the elements of array1
  - Determine the product by multiplying the element at that index for array1 and the element at that index for array2
  - Append this product to the products array
  - Continue until the index equals the size of either array
  - Increment the index
- Return the products array

# Solution 2

Given two arrays of numbers _array1_ and _array2_:
- Create an array with 2-element sub-arrays consisting of array1 elements and array2 elements
- Transform that array such that each sub-array is transformed to the sum of its elements
