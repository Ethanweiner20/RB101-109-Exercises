## Capitalize Words

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: Single argument as a _string_
- **Output**: A string in which every word is capitalized
- The first character of every word should be capitalized, but all other letters should be lowercase
- The output should be a new string, not the original string

*Assumptions*:
- A word is any sequence of non-blank characters
- We can't mutate the original string

*Questions*:
- Should we do anything with leading/trailing blank space?
- Should we avoid mutating the original string?

*Implicit Requirements*:
- If a word starts with a non-alphabetic character (e.g. "), you do not need to capitalize the first alphabetic letter

*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

## DATA STRUCTURES

We will use an array to contain the words.

## ALGORITHM

# Solution 1

Given a _string_:

- Split the string into `words`
- For each `word` in `words`:
  - Downcase the entire word
  - Capitalize the first letter in the word
- Join the words into a string and return

*Sub-Problems*:




## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- String#capitalize: Capitalizes the first character of a string, and converts the remainder to lowercase
- String#chr: Converts an integer to its associated ASCII representation
