## Lettercase Counter

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _string_
- **Output**: A hash providing data about the string, including:
  - The # of "lowercase" letters
  - The # of "uppercase" letters
  - The # of characters that are "neither" uppercase nor lowercase letters

*Questions*:


*Implicit Requirements*:
- Any character can be inputted as part of the string, spaces included
- An empty string => all keys in hash are zero

*Mental Models*:
1. Compute each separately and collect results in hash
2. Compute them in parallel (I'll probably do this)

## EXAMPLES/TESTS



## DATA STRUCTURES



## ALGORITHM

# Solution 1: Straightforward

Given a _string_

- Initialize a hash w/ 3 keys set to zero
- Split the string into characters
- For each `char` in characters:
  - Increment the "lowercase" key in the hash if char is a lowercase letter
  - Increment the "uppercase" key in the hash if char is an uppercase letter
  - Otherwise increment the "neither" key
- Return the hash

# Solution 2: Count each individually

- Create a hash, setting the key-value pairs as follows:
  - The first is the count of the characters that are lowercase
  - The second is the count of the characters that are uppercase
  - The third is the count of the characters that are non-alphabetic
- Return the hash

## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- Use #count w/ a block to count characters meeting a certain criteria
