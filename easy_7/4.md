## Swap Case

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: A _string_ with any characters
- **Output**: A new string in which each uppercase letter is replaced by its lowercase version, & vice versa
- The return value should be a new string
- Non-letter characters are left unchanged
- You may not use String#swapcase

*Questions*:
- Can the original string be mutated to assist with the solution?

*Implicit Requirements*:
- Non-letter characters are 

*Mental Models*:


## EXAMPLES/TESTS

swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'

## DATA STRUCTURES

Array for characters

## ALGORITHM

Given a _string_
- Split the string into characters
- Transform each character as necessary
  - If the character is lowercase, return the uppercase version
  - If the character is upepercase, return the lowercase version
  - Otherwise, return the character itself
- Join the characters back together and return the string

*Sub-Problems*:




## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- Use Regexp to check if a character is lowercase/uppercase OR build an array of lower/uppercase characters & compare
- #map for transformation
