## Multiplicative Average

## PROBLEM

*Explicit Requirements*:
- **Input**: An array of _integers_
- **Output**: A display of the multiplicative average of `integers`, rounded to
3 decimal places

*Questions*:
- Does the return value of the method itself matter?

*Implicit Requirements*:

## EXAMPLES/TESTS

show_multiplicative_average([3, 5])                # => The result is 7.500
show_multiplicative_average([6])                   # => The result is 6.000
show_multiplicative_average([2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]) # => The result is 28361.667

## DATA STRUCTURES



## ALGORITHM

Given an array of _integers_:
- Retrieve the multiplicative average of the integers as a float
- Print this average, rounded to 3 decimal places

*Sub-Problems*:

# Retrieve the multiplicative average

Given an array of _integers_:
- Determine the product of all the integers
- Determine the number of all the integers
- Divide the product by the sum to retrieve the multiplicative average as a FLOAT
- Return this multiplicative average


## CODE

*Implementation Details*:
- Does Array#product exist?
- Convert the product to a float to coerce result to be a float
